## Hey I'm Clyde Freeman 🤚🏾 
### Im a iOS Dev and SuperVillian 🦹🏾‍♂️

I Currently work as an iOS developer and i enjoy bringing beautiful products to life. Im a developer who really believes in the power of design and try to have my hand in both. i believe a product needs to looks as good as it functions. We need Both! Cuz we know ppl DO judge books by their cover. and in this case... if the app is ugly most ppl will leave it right there on the App Store. A Beautiful app has the power to take over the world! 💥
